A Constant Sum Partition is an arrangement of a group of numbers 0-n into smaller sub-groups. To be constant-sum, each of these sub-groups must have the same sum modulo n. For odd numbers this constant sum must equal 0 when multiplied by the number of groups, p, modulo n. For the case when n is even, each grouping must have a constant sum that totals to n/2 when multiplied by the number of groupings, modulo n.
